Core Protocol Components:

1. Connection Pool Management (Importance: 95)
- Dynamic connection scaling with min/max thresholds
- Auto-scaling based on usage patterns
- Connection lifecycle management with idle cleanup
- Connection health metrics and utilization tracking

2. Device Discovery Optimization (Importance: 90)
- Dynamic scan window adjustment based on device density
- Success rate-based optimization
- Adaptive scanning parameters for environmental conditions
- Historical performance tracking for optimization

3. Power Management (Importance: 85)
- Multi-factor power level optimization considering:
  - RSSI readings
  - Battery levels
  - Connection stability
  - Device priority tiers
- Dynamic power adjustments for battery conservation
- Connection quality-based adaptation

4. Priority Scanning System (Importance: 80)
- Weighted priority allocation (4x high, 2x medium, 1x low)
- Adaptive interval optimization
- Scan history with priority distribution metrics
- Dynamic schedule generation based on priorities

5. RSSI Signal Management (Importance: 75)
- Dynamic threshold classification (excellent/good/fair/poor/unusable)
- Adaptive threshold adjustment using moving averages
- Anomaly detection for sudden signal drops
- Minimum 10 dBm separation between categories
- 70% adaptation threshold for adjustments

6. Characteristic Operations (Importance: 85)
- Prioritized batch processing (high/medium/low)
- Intelligent operation batching with configurable sizes
- Automatic retry for high-priority operations
- Subscription management for notifications

Key Protocol Rules:
- Automatic power adjustment based on connection quality
- Priority-based scanning slot allocation
- Signal strength threshold maintenance
- Connection parameter optimization based on device state
- Operation batching with priority queuing
- Dynamic scan window adaptation
