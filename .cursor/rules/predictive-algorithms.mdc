### Resource Prediction Algorithms
- MUST: Implement load prediction using linear regression in `src/metrics/predictiveScaling.js`
- MUST: Maintain configurable 1-hour history window of load measurements
- MUST: Generate 5-minute interval predictions up to 1 hour ahead
- MUST: Enforce minimum 12 data points for reliable predictions
- AVOID: Using single-point predictions without historical context
- WHY: Ensures statistically significant prediction models with sufficient data density
- EXAMPLE: `src/metrics/predictiveScaling.js` implementation of time-series load forecasting

### Multi-Resource Forecasting
- MUST: Track memory, CPU, network metrics separately in `src/metrics/resourceForecasting.js`
- MUST: Implement resource-specific boundaries (CPU: 0-100%, Memory: 0-max)
- MUST: Generate coordinated predictions across all resources
- AVOID: Mixing prediction models across different resource types
- WHY: Different resources have distinct patterns and constraints requiring specialized handling
- EXAMPLE: Resource-specific tracking in `src/metrics/resourceForecasting.js`

### Scaling Recommendations
- MUST: Define thresholds (CPU: 80%, Memory: 80%, Network: 80%) in `src/metrics/scalingRecommendations.js`
- MUST: Implement 300s cooldown between scaling decisions
- MUST: Generate recommendations based on combined resource predictions
- AVOID: Single-metric scaling decisions without considering other resources
- WHY: Prevents thrashing and ensures holistic resource management
- EXAMPLE: Multi-factor decision logic in `src/metrics/scalingRecommendations.js`

### Trend Analysis
- MUST: Implement sliding window analysis in `src/metrics/trendAnalysis.js`
- MUST: Use 10% threshold for significant trend changes
- MUST: Calculate confidence scores based on coefficient of variation
- AVOID: Making trend decisions without minimum 10 data points
- WHY: Ensures reliable trend detection with statistical confidence
- EXAMPLE: Trend classification implementation in `src/metrics/trendAnalysis.js`

### Batch Prediction
- MUST: Use ML-driven batch size prediction in `src/mcp/server/BatchPredictor.js`
- MUST: Consider historical patterns for optimization
- MUST: Adapt predictions based on priority levels
- AVOID: Static batch sizes without historical context
- WHY: Optimizes resource usage through learned patterns
- EXAMPLE: Adaptive batch sizing in `src/mcp/server/BatchPredictor.js`
