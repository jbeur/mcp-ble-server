# data-flow

The system implements a multi-layered data flow architecture centered around the Message Control Protocol (MCP):

1. Message Control Protocol (MCP) Core
- Multi-tier message prioritization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Priority-based batch processing with dynamic sizing
- Custom header protocol:
  - Magic number "MCP" identifier
  - Version tracking
  - Algorithm metadata
- Adaptive compression selection based on data characteristics and size thresholds

2. BLE Data Flow Management
- Connection pooling with adaptive scaling:
  - Auto-scaling based on usage patterns
  - Priority-based connection allocation
  - Health metrics tracking
- Device discovery optimization through:
  - Dynamic scan window adjustment
  - Success rate optimization
  - Environmental condition adaptation

3. Security Data Flow
- Progressive threat tracking with severity classification
- Multi-level session management:
  - Encrypted session storage
  - Single-use authorization codes
  - Automatic expiration handling
- Rate limiting with sliding window implementation

4. Metrics Flow
- Custom metrics collection framework for BLE/WebSocket connections
- Resource prediction system:
  - Memory utilization forecasting
  - CPU usage prediction
  - Network bandwidth forecasting
- SLA violation tracking with priority hierarchy:
  - Availability (99% threshold)
  - Error rate (1% threshold)
  - Response time (1000ms threshold)

5. Inter-Component Communication
- Batch processing system with priority queues
- Dynamic compression selection
- Automatic retry mechanisms for high-priority operations
- Connection parameter optimization based on:
  - Device priority
  - Battery levels
  - Data transfer rates
  - Connection stability

The data flow architecture emphasizes priority-based message handling, secure transmission, and adaptive resource management across all system components.
