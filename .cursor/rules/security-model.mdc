Core Security Architecture:

1. Authentication Framework
- Multi-tier authentication system combining OAuth2 and custom token authentication
- Progressive security checks including session fixation prevention, brute force protection
- Single-use authorization codes with strict client ID binding
- Session management with 1-hour expiration and concurrent limits (max 3 sessions/user)

2. Request Security 
- Custom request signing protocol using HMAC with required headers validation
- 5-minute timestamp tolerance window
- Session-specific encryption using AES-256-GCM
- Dual-token system (access + refresh) with token jittering (0-30s random delay)

3. Rate Limiting & Threat Detection
- Sliding window rate limiting tracking per-client requests
- Immediate blocking for high-severity threats
- Progressive threat tracking per client
- IP-based and Client-based blocking mechanisms
- Auto-blocks after configurable auth failures

4. Device Security Assessment
- Multi-factor security scoring (0-10 scale) based on:
  - Vulnerability scanning results 
  - Authentication security
  - Rate limiting configuration
  - Threat detection posture
- BLE-specific vulnerability scanning:
  - SweynTooth detection
  - BLESA assessment
  - Authentication/encryption validation
  - Attack vector analysis

5. Security Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit trails for security events
- Security scoring with weighted criteria
- Concurrent audit management
- Risk-based security recommendations
