# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a comprehensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device management platform with integrated security, authentication, and monitoring capabilities.

Core Business Architecture:

1. BLE Management Layer
- Connection pooling with adaptive scaling based on device priorities
- Dynamic power level optimization considering RSSI, battery levels, and stability
- Priority-based scanning system with weighted slot allocation
- Characteristic operations with tiered priority processing

2. Authentication & Security
- Multi-level security implementation with progressive checks
- OAuth2-based authorization with strict client binding
- Rate limiting using sliding window algorithm
- Threat detection with severity-based blocking policies
- API key rotation with dual-phase validity periods

3. Device Communication Protocol (MCP)
- Message batching with priority-based ordering
- Priority-weighted connection allocation
- Resource management with multi-dimensional monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern with priority-based recovery

4. Metrics & Monitoring
- SLA monitoring with three-tier violation hierarchy
- Predictive resource management using time-series forecasting
- Comprehensive security scoring system
- Real-time trend analysis for resource utilization

Key Business Components:

src/ble/
- ConnectionPool.js: Dynamic connection management
- PowerLevelAdjustment.js: Multi-factor power optimization
- PriorityScanning.js: Priority-based device discovery

src/security/
- SecurityManager.js: Comprehensive security orchestration
- VulnerabilityScanner.js: BLE-specific vulnerability assessment
- ThreatDetectionService.js: Progressive threat tracking

src/mcp/server/
- MessageBatcher.js: Priority-based message processing
- ResourceLimiter.js: Multi-dimensional resource control
- HighAvailability.js: Priority-weighted failover logic

src/metrics/
- slaMonitoring.js: Three-tier SLA enforcement
- predictiveScaling.js: Resource forecasting
- scalingRecommendations.js: Multi-factor scaling decisions

The system emphasizes priority-based resource management across all components, with specific focus on maintaining reliable BLE connections while optimizing power consumption and security.
