# MCP BLE Server Project Summary

## Project Overview
The MCP BLE Server is a Model Context Protocol server implementation providing BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) capabilities to AI assistants. The project enables AI models to discover, connect to, and communicate with BLE devices through a standardized protocol interface.

## Current Project State

### Completed Phases
1. Core Infrastructure
   - Basic BLE service implementation
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Resource cleanup
   - Configuration and logging systems

2. Documentation
   - API Documentation
   - Error Handling Guide
   - Testing Guide
   - Deployment Guide

3. MCP Protocol Implementation
   - WebSocket server setup
   - Protocol message handling
   - BLE Integration
   - Performance optimization

4. Performance Optimization
   - Message batching and compression
   - Connection pooling
   - Caching implementation
   - Memory and event loop optimization

5. Security Hardening
   - Enhanced authentication system
   - Authorization rules
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Message signing
   - Session encryption
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Automated security testing

### Current Progress
1. Infrastructure Deployment (In Progress)
   - AWS Resources Deployed:
     - VPC with public/private subnets
     - Application Load Balancer
     - RDS Database
     - EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
     - CloudWatch Monitoring
   - Environments:
     - Staging: Deployed and functional
     - Production: Infrastructure ready

2. Remaining Tasks
   - Deployment automation completion
   - Monitoring setup
   - Backup strategy implementation
   - Scaling configuration
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Documentation finalization

## Infrastructure Details
1. VPC Configuration
   - Public and private subnets across AZs
   - NAT Gateways for private subnet access
   - Internet Gateway for public access

2. Load Balancer
   - Application Load Balancer
   - SSL/TLS configuration
   - Target group health checks

3. Database
   - RDS instance in private subnet
   - Automated backups
   - Security group configuration

4. Compute
   - EC2 instances in private subnets
   - Auto Scaling Groups
   - Launch templates with user data

5. Monitoring
   - CloudWatch metrics and alarms
   - Log groups configured
   - Performance monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Complete deployment automation
2. Implement blue-green deployment
3. Set up cross-region replication
4. Configure automated backups
5. Implement disaster recovery
6. Finalize documentation

## Current Issues/Challenges
1. ESLint configuration needs setup
2. Git hooks require configuration
3. Monitoring and alerting setup pending
