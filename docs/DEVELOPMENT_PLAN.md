# MCP BLE Server Development Plan

## 1. Requirements Gathering

### Device Support
- Initial device types to support:
  - Health monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, activity tracking)
  - Smart lights (dimmable, color control, scheduling)
  - Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality)
  - Smart locks (lock/unlock, status monitoring)

### BLE GATT Profiles
- Research and document required GATT profiles:
  - Health monitoring profiles (HMP)
  - Light control profiles
  - Environmental monitoring profiles
  - Security device profiles

### MCP Endpoints
- Define endpoints for LLM interactions:
  - Device discovery and connection
  - Device status monitoring
  - Command execution
  - Data retrieval
  - Error handling and reporting

### Security Requirements
- Authentication:
  - Device pairing and bonding
  - User authentication
  - Session management
- Encryption:
  - BLE security modes
  - Data encryption in transit
  - Secure storage of credentials

### Performance Requirements
- Connection time: < 2 seconds
- Response latency: < 500ms
- Maximum concurrent connections: 10
- Battery efficiency optimization
- Connection stability and reconnection handling

        "characteristics": [
          {
            "uuid": "string",
            "properties": ["read", "write", "notify"],
            "description": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "security": {
      "required": ["authentication", "encryption"],
      "mode": "string"
    }
  }
  ```

### Protocol Design
