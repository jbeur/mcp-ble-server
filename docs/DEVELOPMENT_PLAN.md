# MCP BLE Server Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The MCP BLE Server enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with BLE-enabled devices through a standardized Model Context Protocol implementation. This server serves as a bridge between AI assistants and BLE devices, providing a unified interface for device discovery, connection, and communication.

## 2. Implementation Phases

## 6. Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. BLE Stack Compatibility
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing across platforms
   - Fallback: Platform-specific implementations

2. Performance Under Load
   - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization
   - Fallback: Connection pooling and rate limiting

3. Security Vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Regular security audits
   - Fallback: Strict access controls and monitoring

## 7. Timeline

Total Duration: 9 weeks
- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks

## 8. Next Steps
