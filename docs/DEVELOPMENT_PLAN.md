# MCP BLE Server Development Plan

## Project Overview
The MCP BLE Server is a bridge between AI assistants and BLE devices, enabling seamless communication and control. The server provides a standardized interface for discovering, connecting to, and interacting with BLE devices.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2) [IN PROGRESS]
- [x] Project setup and repository initialization
- [x] Configuration system implementation
- [x] Basic BLE service implementation
  - [x] Device scanning
  - [x] Connection management
  - [x] GATT service discovery
- [x] Logging framework setup
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Custom error classes
  - [x] Error recovery strategies
  - [x] Retry mechanisms
  - [x] Comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Phase 2: MCP Protocol Implementation (Week 3-4)
- [ ] MCP message format implementation
- [ ] Command processing system
- [ ] Response handling
- [ ] Event notification system
- [ ] Protocol validation and testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Device type mapping system
- [ ] Characteristic read/write operations
- [ ] Notification handling
- [ ] Service caching
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (Week 7-9)
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Deployment documentation

## Success Criteria
- [x] Configuration system works correctly
- [x] BLE device discovery and connection management functions properly
- [x] Error handling and recovery mechanisms are robust and tested
- [ ] MCP protocol implementation passes all tests
- [ ] Device operations (read/write/notify) work reliably
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Technical Stack
- Node.js
- Noble (BLE library)
- Winston (logging)
- Jest (testing)
- YAML (configuration)
