# MCP BLE Server Development Plan

## Project Overview
The MCP BLE Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) capabilities to AI assistants. It enables AI models to discover, connect to, and communicate with BLE devices through a standardized protocol interface. The server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and BLE devices, providing a secure and reliable communication channel.
