# MCP BLE Server Development Plan

## Project Overview
The MCP BLE Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) capabilities to AI assistants. It enables AI models to discover, connect to, and communicate with BLE devices through a standardized protocol interface. The server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and BLE devices, providing a secure and reliable communication channel.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Reliable BLE device discovery and connection
- [x] Robust error handling and recovery
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Test coverage > 80% (Current: 92.44%)
- [x] MCP Protocol Implementation
- [x] AI Assistant Integration
- [-] Performance optimization (In Progress)

- [ ] Production deployment readiness

## Technical Stack
- Node.js >= 14.x
- CommonJS modules
- Jest for testing
- Winston for logging
- Prometheus for metrics
- PM2 for process management
